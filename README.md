# Othello Assignment

This is a submission to a project for BME121: Digital Computation. 

This code is a recreation of the board game Othello, where players take turns placing down White or Black token, represented by 'O' and 'X' 
respectively for this rendition. The game is fully implemented with a scoring system and game completion conditions.
